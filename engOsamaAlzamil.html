        Merely moments ago we concluded our meeting with His Excellency Engineer Osama Al Zamil deputy minister of industry and mineral resources.
        His career journey starting from his education in KFUPM to studying abroad In the US to its destination in today's industry
        was one of the topics that were discussed as well working in a family business and the difference between the private and 
        governmental sectors and the chances that the promising youth has in both. And we concluded the meeting with some precious advice for the Majlis members.
